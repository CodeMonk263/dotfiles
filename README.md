# Vidur's Dotfile
## This is Vidur Butalia's dotfile collection

This repo includes my 'dotfiles' (configuration files for most command-line 
and some GUI applications) as well as basic tooling (shell scripts) I have written 
myself to set up my dotfiles on a new terminal.

I use Arctic Ice Studio's excellent Nord colorscheme wherever possible. 
I would encourage you to check out their repos if you like the look of my 
tools. [Arctic Ice Studio](https://github.com/arcticicestudio)
